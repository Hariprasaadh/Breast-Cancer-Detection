# Breast-Cancer-Detection

This repository contains the code and resources for a Breast Cancer Detection project using the dataset from Kaggle. The main objective of this project is to build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether a breast cancer tumor is malignant or benign based on various features.

Project Overview

1. Data Preprocessing
3. Use Logistic Regression for classification
4. Model Evaluation
5. Validate the model using Confusion Matrix
6. Apply k-Fold Cross Validation to assess model performance

Conclusion

The Logistic Regression model achieved satisfactory results in classifying breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign. Feature scaling and k-Fold Cross Validation contributed to the model's performance and reliability.
